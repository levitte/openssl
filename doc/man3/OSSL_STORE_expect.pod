=head1 NAME

OSSL_STORE_expect - Specify what object type is expected

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/store.h>

 int OSSL_STORE_expect(OSSL_STORE_CTX *ctx, int expected_type);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

OSSL_STORE_expect() helps applications filter what OSSL_STORE_load() returns
by specifying a B<OSSL_STORE_INFO> type.
For example, if C<file:/foo/bar/store.pem> contains several different objects
and only the certificates are interesting, the application can simply say
that it expects the type B<OSSL_STORE_INFO_CERT>.

OSSL_STORE_expect() I<must> be called before the first OSSL_STORE_load()
of a given session, or it will fail.

=head1 NOTES

If a more elaborate filter is required by the application, a better choice
would be to use a post-processing function.
See L<OSSL_STORE_open(3)> for more information.

However, some loaders may take advantage of the knowledge of an expected type
to make object retrieval more efficient, so if a single type is expected, this
method is usually preferable.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

OSSL_STORE_expect() returns 1 on success, or 0 on failure.
